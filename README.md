**GRAPH IMPLEMEMNTATIONS IN PYTHON:**
This repository demonstates various graphs representations and operations implemented using matrices in python
The types of graphs included are:
1. Undirected Graph
2. Directed Graph
3. Cycle Graph
4. Acyclic Graph
5. Weighted Graph

**#FEATURES:**
1. Undirected Graph
-Stores an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix.
-Allows adding edges and vertex data.
-Prints the adjacency matrix and vertex data.
2. Directed Graph
-Represents a directed graph using an adjacency matrix with weights.
-Supports weighted edges between vertices.
-Prints the adjacency matrix with weights and vertex data.
3. Cycle Graph
-Implements a method to detect cycles in an undirected graph using Depth First Search (DFS).
-Includes a test case to demonstrate the detection of cycles in a sample graph.
4. Acyclic Graph
-Represents a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with an adjacency matrix.
-Allows adding directed edges and vertex data.
-Prints the graph's structure.
5. Weighted Graph
-Represents a weighted undirected graph.
-Supports adding weighted edges and vertex data.
-Prints the graph structure, including weights.

**HOW TO RUN:**
1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a Python file.
2. Install Python 3 if you donâ€™t have it already.
