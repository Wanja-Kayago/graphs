**#Graph Implementations in Python**
This repository demonstates various graphs representations and operations implemented using matrices in python
The types of graphs included are:
-Undirected Graph
-Directed Graph
-Cycle Graph
-Acyclic Graph
-Weighted Graph

**##Features**
1. Undirected Graph
-Stores an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix.
-Allows adding edges and vertex data.
-Prints the adjacency matrix and vertex data.
2. Directed Graph
-Represents a directed graph using an adjacency matrix with weights.
-Supports weighted edges between vertices.
-Prints the adjacency matrix with weights and vertex data.
3. Cycle Graph
-Implements a method to detect cycles in an undirected graph using Depth First Search (DFS).
-Includes a test case to demonstrate the detection of cycles in a sample graph.
4. Acyclic Graph
-Represents a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with an adjacency matrix.
-Allows adding directed edges and vertex data.
-Prints the graph's structure.
5. Weighted Graph
-Represents a weighted undirected graph.
-Supports adding weighted edges and vertex data.
-Prints the graph structure, including weights.
